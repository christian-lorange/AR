This demo is an updated working version of index_UScities.html, part of the XDK [html5-augmented-reality-app project](
https://github.com/krisrak/html5-augmented-reality-app). XDK deprecated its augmented reality features.


Modifications to the original project:  
* Configured the AR UI to use transparent background and semi-transparent city distance markers
* Added ezAR VideoOverlay and Snapshot plugins
* Added snapshot button and onclick action to use the snapshot plugin feature
* Added ezAR attribution text
